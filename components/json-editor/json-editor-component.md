# JSON Editor Component

The provided JavaScript code defines a custom HTML element called `json-editor`. This element utilizes the `JSONEditor` class from the `vanilla-jsoneditor` library to create a JSON editor component. The editor allows users to view, edit, and interact with JSON data. This documentation provides an overview of the usage, structure, and functionality of the `json-editor` component.

## Usage

To use the `json-editor` component, include the provided JavaScript code in your project and import the `vanilla-jsoneditor` library. Then, use the element in your HTML as follows:

```html
<json-editor values='{"key": "value"}'></json-editor>
```

This will create a JSON editor with the initial content set to the specified JSON values.

## Structure

The `json-editor` component is implemented as a custom HTML element extending the `HTMLElement` class. It includes the following key components:

- **Constructor**: Initializes the `jsonEditorComponent` class.
  
- **connectedCallback**: Called when the element is added to the document. It retrieves the initial JSON content from the `values` attribute, parses it, and initializes the JSON editor.

- **init**: Initializes the `JSONEditor` instance, specifying the target element and defining properties such as the initial content and the `onChange` callback.

- **updateData**: Updates the data displayed in the editor with the provided JSON value.

- **observedAttributes**: Specifies that changes to the `values` attribute should be observed.

- **attributeChangedCallback**: Called when an observed attribute (in this case, `values`) changes. It updates the editor's content with the new attribute value.

## Functionality

The `JSONEditor` instance is created inside the `init` method, targeting the current `json-editor` element. The initial content of the editor is set based on the `values` attribute. The `onChange` callback is used to track changes made in the editor, updating the internal `content` property and dispatching a custom 'save' event with the updated content.

The `updateData` method allows external updates to the JSON data displayed in the editor. This method is triggered by changes to the `values` attribute.

## Events

The component dispatches a custom 'save' event whenever the JSON content in the editor is modified. This event includes details such as the updated content and a timestamp.

## External Dependencies

The component relies on the `vanilla-jsoneditor` library, which must be included in the project. Import it using the following CDN link:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vanilla-jsoneditor/index.js"></script>
```

Make sure to include this script before using the `json-editor` element in your HTML.
