## Next steps: 

#next-steps
- Syncing Notebooks between devices
  - SyncThings?
- File Storage and Uploading by click and drag
- better styling
- hashtag and link graph
  - #hashtags should be change URL params, not hashs...
  - Currently Params Change, but I cannot detect those changes
  
- #link-graph
  - 3d Visualizations, search files. SQL database?
  
- Stable Diffusion Component
  - #stable-diffusion-component
  - Image indexing / saving
  
- Presentation Mode
  - voice search @depends-on #database
  
- LLM Integration
  - Chat GPT at first, generates embedded markdown file tagged as AI generated
```
{ 
  date-generated:"date", 
  type: "AI-GENERATED",
  keywords: [keywords, here],
}
```  
- #docs

- AI tools
  - Generate Keywords in JSON
  - Generate Summaries
  
- Ctrl-P / Voice Commands
  - Commands can be accessed either from palette or "Hey _AI NAME_"
  - Context Menu for commands
  - #context-menu
  - Load Files
  - Save Files
  - New Journal Entry
  - Presentation Mode
  - Exploration Mode
  - Editor Mode
  - Full Screen Mode
  - #fullscreen-mode
  
  
- Code Embed 
  - Render Code
  

- Prompt Framework
  - Generate Random Prompts
  - #prompt-constructor
  
- Embed Specific Lines of Code from a file (and edit them!)
  - #embedded-editor-component

- Web Worker Template
  - Template that creates a webworker
  
- Last Updated
- Has Page been indexed since last update? 
  
- Versioning? 

- #git-submodule-interface
  - For versioning of notes
  - For installation of components
  
- Rename Components to Plugins?
- Move LNSY-EDIT to dev-components folder
- Building ignores dev-components folder

- Variable Embeds
  - Embed variables from the files JSON with ```${}``` format 
  - Replace variables on render
  - maybe 
  ```html
    <json-var id="blahblah"></json-var>
  ```
  
- 3D Editor / Viewer
  - Just use aframe? a-entity, but have transfer compoennts
  ```html
    <a-entity>
    <shipping-container size="10ft"></shipping-container>
    </a-entity>

  When attributes are updated, the update the entity attached to it are updated also

 - Multi Window Support
   - Should allow syncing between instances, using WebRTC -- different computers, 
   all part of the same interface.
- Each day has a folder of assets -- AI generated images that day, downloads
- Media Library Interface -- slideshows, indexing, tagging, etc
- Exif Parser
- Way to embed text into a new note
- Way to keep running lists, scattered between notes-- 
```
@links
```
@links exist to bind together notes, without generating a new hashtag

Links list: generates

- render different contexts

- VR context works in VR
