# Generate New Component Manual

## Introduction:

Welcome to the "Generate New Component" application! This tool allows you to easily create new components for your web development projects. The application is divided into two parts: the front-end (browser) and the back-end (Node.js server). This manual will guide you through the process of using the application step by step.

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Requirements:

- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.).
- Node.js installed on your computer.

### 1.2 Installation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install Node.js dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 2. Using the Application

### 2.1 Accessing the Form:

- Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- You will see a form titled "Generate new Component."

### 2.2 Filling out the Form:

1. **Select Template:**
   - Choose a template from the dropdown list.

2. **Title (required):**
   - Enter a title for your component.

3. **Description:**
   - Optionally, provide a description for your component.

4. **Submitting the Form:**
   - Once the form is complete, the "Create Component" button will become enabled.

### 2.3 Previewing the Component:

- As you type a title for your component, a preview of how the component's HTML tag will look and the corresponding component name will be dynamically displayed.

### 2.4 Submitting the Form:

- Click the "Create Component" button to submit the form and generate a new component.
- The generated component details will be displayed on the page.

## 3. Server-Side Operations

### 3.1 Component Generation:

- When you submit the form, the server will create a new component based on the provided data.

### 3.2 Template Retrieval:

- The server retrieves available component templates, allowing you to choose from existing options.

## 4. Troubleshooting

### 4.1 Common Issues:

- If the application is not working as expected, ensure that Node.js is installed and the server is running.

### 4.2 Error Messages:

- If you encounter any error messages, check the console in your web browser and the terminal where the server is running for more information.

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to use the "Generate New Component" application. If you have any issues or questions, refer to the troubleshooting section or seek assistance from the development community. Happy coding!

### Summary:

The provided code consists of both front-end (browser) and back-end (Node.js) components that work together to generate a new component. The front-end is responsible for presenting a form to the user, taking input, and sending it to the server. The back-end receives the data, processes it, and returns information about the generated component.

### Front-End (Browser) Code:

1. **HTML (index.html):**
   - Defines the structure of the HTML page.
   - Includes JavaScript modules (`index.js` and `generate-new-component.js`) and stylesheets.
   - Creates a custom style for the `generate-new-component` element.
   - Sets the title of the page.

2. **JavaScript (generate-new-component.js):**
   - Defines utility functions for form validation, data extraction, and string manipulation.
   - Implements a custom HTML element `generate-new-component` using the Custom Elements API.
   - Creates a form with input fields for selecting a template, providing a title, and describing the component.
   - Dynamically updates the form based on user input, including generating a preview of the component name.
   - Submits the form data to the server using a POST request.
   - Displays the generated component details after submission.

### Back-End (Node.js) Code:

1. **Server Code (index.js):**
   - Sets up an Express.js server.
   - Defines two routes:
     - `/generate-new-component` (POST): Handles form submissions, generates a new component, and returns details.
     - `/get-component-templates` (GET): Retrieves available component templates.

2. **Component Generation Code (generate-component.js):**
   - Reads metadata from a JSON file and exports a function.
   - Defines a function to get a list of component templates.
   - The exported function takes Express.js app as a parameter.
   - Handles POST requests on `/generate-new-component`, extracting data, and calling a function to generate component details.
   - Handles GET requests on `/get-component-templates`, retrieving and returning available component templates.

### Overall Flow:

1. The user interacts with the front-end form to input details for a new component.
2. The form dynamically updates to show a preview of the component name.
3. Upon submission, the data is sent to the server via a POST request.
4. The server generates the component based on the received data.
5. The server responds with details about the generated component.
6. The front-end displays the generated component details to the user.

This code structure enables the dynamic creation of components based on user input, providing a seamless interaction between the browser and server. The server-side logic includes template retrieval and component generation, while the client-side manages the user interface and form submissions.
